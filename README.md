# Introduction

This repository contains a set of scripts and dotfiles for setting up a new Macbook.

### Automated setup

1. Sign in in App Store

2. Run `./setup.sh`

> Running the script repeatedly will install missing packages and upgrade the existing ones.

3. Run `./setup_ssh.sh` (if you need a new SSH key)

### Manual setup

Not everything is on Appstore. Some good tools should be installed manually:

- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)

I use Chrome for surfing the web, because it's also good for development. Chrome plugins must be installed manually:
